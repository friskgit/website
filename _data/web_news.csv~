<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
In this article we discuss the notion of interaction, participation and the public in artistic work, specifically within the context of the exhibition The Invisible Landscapes (curated by Miya Yoshida, Malmö Konstmuseum, 2003) and etherSound (created by Henrik Frisk), a sound installation displayed in that exhibition. In this work the audience is invited to participate in the creation of new sound events by sending text messages from their mobile phones. Thus, our discussion is focused on the space and the mode of participation opened up by new communication technology. Based on our experiences of that project, we introduce and explain what we believe are relations of creative production and a different kind of creativity that may emerge from active interaction. We also attempt to describe what we believe an implementation of active public participation can lead to.

We are combining two modes of thinking in this article; one is inspired by a discourse of cultural theories and the other by reflection on our experience of the event. The latter is, by definition, rather subject centred and expansive based on individual observation. We examine and analyse the phenomenon of participation whilst playing etherSound as a process of creative production, and seek to reflect upon the power of the co-operative practice and its relation to participation and creativity.";"bilder/spacer.gif"

On this tour, starting March 28 in Stockholm and ending April 4 in Härnösand, Henrik Frisk will also perform live electronics with the trio, in his own piece as well as in improvisations. The collaboration started in the spring of 2006 with the main ambition to create a foundation for a meeting between two different musical cultures on equal terms. ";"An other ambition with The Six Tones has been to reach beyond merely a superimposition of elements and strive for a more coherent and experimentally oriented sound. From this point of departure Henrik Frisk composed a trio for Dan Tranh, Dan Bau, banjo, e-bow, 10-stringed guitar and electronics premiered at a concert in Hanoi in October -06. The improvisations over traditional Vietnamese music - also part of the touring program - have been important guiding posts while navigating this difficult territory.</p>

Although it is questionable whether distribution companies such as CDA should at all receive government support (that support may be better served else where in the chain of production), fact reamins that it will be very difficult in the future for Swedish experimental music to get distribution outside of their own channels. On the other hand one may argue that the CD as a product has, or at least will, become redundant and that it is not ecologically sane to physically distribute pieces of plastic when most consumers have the technology necessary to receive and perceive the music virtually.";"bilder/kopa/KopaseticProductions.gif"

In this essay I look at various aspects of the conscious/unconscious continuum in relation to

Drawing on the work of anthropologist Gregory Bateson I make use of the idea that the unconcious is
structured in a manner distinct from the conscious. Furthermore I evaluate the assumption that art in
general and improvisation specifically, communicate according to the logic of the unconscious. These two
arguments are used to give an experimental account as to the validity of using the computer as an
instrument in the context of freely improvised music.";"bilder/spacer.gif"

<p>
In this essay the first initiatives are presented to come to a new theoretical approach of musical improvisation. The main idea is to regard musical improvisation as a nonlinear dynamical system in which various (f)actors interact and connect in complex ways. In other words, the Field of Musical Improvisation (FMI) has no stable or strict identity.</p>";"http://konturen.uoregon.edu/images/title.jpg"

";"This is what James Elkins from The Art Institute of Chicago writes about it:

<blockquote>
The practice-led PhD, which began in the U.K., is now ubiquitous in several parts of the world. As the doctorate becomes more settled in university life, it becomes increasingly important to reach a balanced understanding of its basic concepts, methods, and outcomes. What is artistic research? How does art create new knowledge? How can a PhD-level art exhibition be assessed for quality? This book is the first comprehensive look at concepts such as research, knowledge, creativity, the visual, experiment, quality, and assessment, as they are used in practice-based programmes influenced by the U.K. and E.U. models of higher education. Now that art is being taught in universities at the doctoral level, it may spur a fundamental rethinking of the universitys basic concepts of professionalism, community, and purpose. For that reason this book is also an irreplaceable resource for those interested in the coherence and idea of the university as a whole.

international sessions on artistic research in music</h4>
<h2>November 28 - December 1 </h2>
<p>
Bringing together musicians working in different traditions of musical improvisation, (Re)thinking Improvisation - an international research project organized by the Malmö Academy of Music - now takes the initiative to organize an event in which musicians and scholars from various disciplines can get together in order to explore improvisation from a multidisciplinary and globalized perspective. </p>";"<p>Centered around the concept of the lab as a venue for a review of artistic work as process, the ambition is to merge various kinds of knowledge production in the arts with various analytical modes of thinking. Each member of the research project will direct sessions to which a wide range of artists and scholars will be invited to contribute in the form of performances, art works, papers, lecture recitals and any other format that is pertinent to the argument one wants to make. These lab sessions are the core of the event. However, (Re)thinking Improvisation also hosts a series of public concerts in and around Malmö. There will be no parallel sessions so all participants can take part in all labs and, furthermore, each day invited artists/scholars will sum up and critically review the sessions that have taken place. Our ambition is to create a format for discussion and dissemination of artistic work and thinking about and through artistic work, while avoiding the all too common theory/practice dichotomies and allow for a creative and intellectually vital environment in which artistic and scholarly approaches to the topic of improvisation can be molded together.
</p><p>
The sessions will primarily take place in the facilities of the Inter Arts Center (www.iac.lu.se) which affords flexible and technically well equipped venues for both music and visual arts. In addition, some of the sessions and many of the public concerts will be scheduled in other venues that are particularly suited for the content of the event.
</p>
<h2>Call for contributions</h2>
<p>
We welcome proposals that address improvisation from a wide range of perspectives and in various formats. We particularly welcome contributions in artistic form (also in artistic expressions other than music). Accepted contributions will be organized as parts of thematized sessions, establishing a critical dialogue. Deadline for proposals is May 15. The submissions will be peer-reviewed and a notification of acceptance will be announced no later than June 15. The description of the content and format of the presentation should be no more than 300 words and may also include audio and video material. The contributions may be of variable length but should not be more than 20 minutes. Please also indicate what kind of venue that might be suitable for the contribution and list any technical requirements. All accepted contributions will be published in the multimedia publication which will constitute the peer reviewed conference proceedings.
</p><p>

<br /><h4>About Copenhagen Art Ensemble</h4>Copenhagen Art Ensemble consists of fourteen musicians and is considered one of Denmark's most interesting and groundbreaking large ensembles in contemporary jazz. Since 1996 conductor Ture Larsen and saxophonist Lotte Anker have fronted the ensemble.
</p><p>
The fourteen musicians who make up the band are all strong ensemble players, as well as individually personal and colourful soloists/improvisers, and together they make up the substance of the unique sound that is characteristic of Copenhagen Art Ensemble. Similarly, the ensemble combines \"small group\" qualities like energy, flexibility, spontaneity and improvisational freedom with the complex colour and rhythmic potential of the large ensemble.
</p><p>
Copenhagen Art Ensemble plays new music composed especially for the band, and has since the start in 1996 played more than 100 concerts mainly in the Nordic countries and premiered over 50 works by a wide range of Danish composers like John Tchicai, Marilyn Mazur, Pierre Dørge, Kim Kristensen, Irene Becker, Fredrik Lundin, Thomas Agergaard, Jakob Riis, Jens Hørsving, Ture Larsen and Lotte Anker.
</p><p>
In addition the ensemble has played concerts with - and music by - international soloists/composers such as Django Bates (UK), Jon Balke (N), Tim Berne (USA), Jan Levander (S), Peter Danemo (S), Joachim Kühn (D) and Joakim Milder (S).
</p><p>
Copenhagen Art Ensemble is based on a vision of performing music that reaches beyond the usual genre boundaries and stylistic barriers within and among different forms of artistic expression. ";"bilder/spacer.gif"

The project is the brainchild of brothers Marcin and Tomek
Ebert. Inspired by analog imagery, they produce images by analog optical and electronic devices, using overhead projectors, cameras
and video equalizers. The core component of their performance setup is an analog overhead projector which displays oil dish
projections creating a continuously varying array of multicoloured forms giving their work an distinct analog feel.This analog art presentation is blended together with live camera input in real time. The fusion of analog
medium and live video changes every performance into a unique visual art form. 
</p><p>
The moving image is tightly integrated with sound. During concerts, interaction between visual artists and musicians often results
in musical improvisations. AnalogVisuals have collaborated with artists such as Mazzoll, Masecki, Tworzywo sztuczne,Trifonidis
Orchestra and many others. They have performed sets at over 100 concerts and festivals in Poland, Berlin, Prague and Kaliningrad.

</p><p>
Young, ambitious, and dedicated. Ensemble MidtVests eleven players are classically trained musicians, all of whom specialize in chamber music. Eleven individuals who have won numerous prizes in international chamber music competitions, all educated at leading European music academies. Together they form a dynamic ensemble performing a huge range of chamber music on an international level.
</p><p>
Founded in 2002, Ensemble MidtVest consists of a string quartet, a wind quintet, and a pianist. The ensemble is renowned for its creative programming, pushing the boundaries of the traditional classical concert form through creativity and excellence.

Ensemble MidtVest performs more than 80 concerts every year in Denmark and abroad. Each year, the ensemble performs more than 15 different programmes and productions, regularly incorporating other musical styles and art forms.  In addition to classical chamber music, Ensemble MidtVest frequently works with improvisation, creating its own sound and musical language, breaking down barriers between musical styles and genres and expanding the performers musical intuition and individuality. Assisting in this process, world-renowned Danish jazz pianist Carsten Dahl was appointed the ensembles first Artistic Advisor in 2007.

In a project related to his installation Ten Thousand Waves we will also perform the music live at the opening of <a href=\"http://goteborg.biennal.org/en/\">Göteborg Intenational Biennal for Contemporary Art</a>.";"<h4><span class=\"c6\">Henrik Frisk and Stefan &Ouml;stersj&ouml;: Music For a Better </span><span class=\"c6\">Life</span><sup><a href=\"#cmnt1\" name=\"cmnt_ref1\">[a]</a></sup></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>&nbsp;</span></h4><p class=\"c0\"><span>With its urgent experimental narrative and exquisite imagery, </span><span class=\"c3\">Better Life</span><span>&nbsp;is a film with immediate appeal. Thematically, it has many links to our own artistic practice, but our first contact with the film raised several questions concerning the form for our collaboration with Isaac Julien. Firstly: isn&rsquo;t this a completed work? Where is the scope for new music to change or complement the perspective for this elegantly formulated totality? And how could the sound effects, the voice-over text and existing music soundtrack be incorporated in our adaptation?</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>&nbsp; </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>In contrast to the notion of a fixed work, defined by one solitary (usually male) originator &ndash; a concept that is linked in western art music to the score&rsquo;s authoritarian definition of the work&rsquo;s identity &ndash; music, as a socially defined phenomenon, can be a platform where we create shared, common cultural meanings. The various levels at which we create, interpret and share the experience of musical &ldquo;works&rdquo; forms the basis for an understanding of what Umberto Eco calls a &ldquo;work in movement&rdquo;. Perhaps the most important change that has taken place in this new understanding of the musical work is the shift in focus from the score and the fixed work to the encounter with a diversity of listeners.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>Our meeting with Isaac in London last June developed into an opening and a natural continuation of our own ongoing projects. He immediately declared that he was less interested in finalised works (products) than in the development of a work over time, through new versions. This gave us a common platform that we could use to approach the various audio and visual elements of the film as being in part mutually independent. The music of a scene could be replaced by new sounds, while the original </span><span>sound</span><sup><a href=\"#cmnt2\" name=\"cmnt_ref2\">[b]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;effects could be kept or processed; concrete sounds as abstract, musical units.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>And then, when we watched the version of </span><span class=\"c3\">Better Life</span><span>&nbsp;that was made for nine monitors, each with its own narrative and temporal perspective, the last piece of the puzzle fell into place. We had come with a temporally linear and fixed experience of the film, and left the meeting with Isaac with a conceptually and formally dynamic and non-linear understanding of it. The nine parallel images together created a rhythm of a remarkably musical nature. One of the distinguishing features of </span><span>music </span><sup><a href=\"#cmnt3\" name=\"cmnt_ref3\">[c]</a></sup><span>is that several independent parts can interact without blurring their individual contours.

Our point of departure will be to create a dynamic between silence, sound effects and instrumental timbres, where our improvisations will depart from what is basically an electro-acoustic and compositional form of listening. Our main method is to electronically process the film&rsquo;s various audio-objects with the aim of creating soundscapes that relate to the film but also develop and attain their own drama.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>Since 2006, we have been involved in projects with Vietnamese musicians, mainly within the context of the group </span><span class=\"c3\">The Six Tones </span><span>(</span><span class=\"c5\"><a class=\"c8\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/thesixtones\">www.myspace.com/thesixtones</a></span><span>), that constitute an encounter between traditional Vietnamese music and experimental Western European music. Our main </span><span>objective</span><sup><a href=\"#cmnt5\" name=\"cmnt_ref5\">[e]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;in that project has been to find forms for interaction between different cultures on equal terms. This entails challenging the notion of &ldquo;centre&rdquo; and &ldquo;periphery&rdquo;: long after the discovery that the world rotates around the sun, Westerners have persisted in their Euro-centric thinking. Hence, the complex asymmetry between continents that is revealed in </span><span class=\"c3\">Better Life</span><span>&nbsp;also reverberates in our work with </span><span class=\"c3\">The Six Tones</span><span>, and our way into this theme in the film is consequently to incorporate our multilayered work with traditional Vietnamese music.

Where </span><span class=\"c3\">Repetition Repeats All Other Repetitions</span><span>&nbsp;&ndash; a work whose basic concept is that multiple versions arise with every new performance &ndash; is an interaction between musician and electronics, our version of </span><span class=\"c3\">Symphonie Diagonale </span><span>showed how Eggeling&rsquo;s film can serve as a partner in the interaction: the guitar piece is structured according to the abstract shapes in the film. </span><span>The present project in collaboration with Isaac Julien takes these approaches even </span><span>further</span><sup><a href=\"#cmnt6\" name=\"cmnt_ref6\">[f]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;along a similar track. Better Life, with its original visual and sonic materials will be the fundamental structuring element in our performances.

This edition of <a href=\"http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=proj&about=0&field=id&query=4\">The Six Tones</a> features apart from Stefan Östersjö and I, Nguyen Thanh Thuy (Dan Tranh) and Tri Minh (laptop). We will perform a program of improvisations and traditional Vietnamese music.";"<h3>Kalv: International Venue 
  for New Music Development</h3>

<p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">The idea of the Kalv Festival is 
  to create a forum where new music can develop and reach new audiences. The festival 
  was held for the first time in 2004, and is an annual event. </font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">In addition to concerts we want to 
  create a forum and a form for development with the aim of strengthening the 
  position of contemporary music in society. With this in mind we have set up 
  the Project Lab, where ensembles, composers, and anyone who works with new music 
  can run their own development projects in cooperation with people who work in 
  other areas of society. These might include both other art forms, science, social 
  institutions, trade and industry etc. The Kalv Festival will be a meeting-point 
  and a reporting forum for the Project Lab.</font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">The Kalv meeting-point will also 
  offer organisations from musical life the opportunity to meet for conferences 
  and seminars, and forge new contacts. Some of the seminars will be open to the 
  public and linked to the festival itself.</font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">The Kalv Festival is being arranged 
  by the Kalvfestivalen society with support from Region V&auml;stra G&ouml;taland, 
  Rikskonserter, Svenljunga municipality, the Swedish National Council for Cultural 
  Affairs, The Royal Swedish Academy of Music, Levande Musik, the School of Music 
  and Music Education at G&ouml;teborg University, Bor&aring;s Art Museum, the Kalv Village Community 
  and others.</font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"><b>THE KALV MEETING-POINT</b><br>
  The Kalv Festival offers a meeting-point for organisations from musical life 
  and for people interested in music. We believe that new music is best developed 
  in the encounter between composers, musicians, audiences and society. By holding 
  ordinary board meetings, conferences, etc in Kalv, contact with other people 
  active in the field of new music can be spontaneous and congenial.</font></p>

<p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">We also invite members of the public 
  with an interest in music to join us in Kalv to attend a series of seminars 
  around the festival's concerts.</font></p>
<p><font face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"><b>THE PROJECT LAB </b><br>
  The Project lab is the part of the Kalv Festival that runs the whole year, offering 
  the opportunity to run development projects where ensembles, composers, arrangers, 
  etc. cooperate with branches of knowledge in the humanities, natural sciences 
  or social sciences and/or with other forms of art, crafts, trade and industry 
  etc. The Kalv festival will mark the beginning and conclusion of the projects. 
  The aim of the Project Lab is to channel creative support from other areas of 
  society to the new art of music, just as society will benefit from new music's 
  specific way of formulating our contemporary reality.</font></p>

</p>
<p>Read more <a href=\"http://www.neokultur.se/quartet-plugged/\">about the concert and about NEO here</a>.";"I Quartet Plugged utforskar Aniarakvartetten elförstärkt musik för stråkkvartett, en genre som skapades i och med George Crumbs kommentar om vietnamkriget, Black Angels  Thirteen images from the dark land, från 1970.
Saker och ting ställdes på ända. Fruktansvärda saker låg i luften [...] de fann sin väg in i Black Angels  George Crumb om sitt verk 1990.
</p><p>
Black Angels är troligen det enda verket för stråkkvartett som inspirerats av vietnamkriget. Crumb använder sig av uttryck som rop, mässande, visslande, viskande, gong-gong, maracas och vattestämda kristallglas. Partituret har två inskriptioner: In tempore belli (i krigstid) och Finished on Friday the Thirteenth, March, 1970 (Slutfört fredagen den trettonde mars 1970).
I Black Angels återfinns allusioner till flera tonala verk: Schuberts stråkkvartett Döden och Flickan citeras i satsen Pavana Lachrymae och ekon från Schuberts kvartett återkommer också i verkets sista sida. Referenser till den medeltida hymnen Dies Irae (vredens dag), återfinns vid flera tillfällen i verket, liksom citat ur Tartinis Djävulsdrillen. Tonalitet och numerologi används för att symbolisera förhållandet mellan ondska och godhet och djävulen och gud.
</p><p>
Förutom Black Angels spelar kvartetten även två nyskrivna verk av tonsättarna Daniel Hjort och Stefan Klaverdal beställda av Aniarakvartetten med stöd av Konstnärsnämnden.
</p><p>
Aniarakvartetten bildades 1995 när medlemmarna fortfarande studerade på musikhögskolor runt om i Europa. Kvartetten var länge baserad i Malmö, men tre av medlemmarna är födda och uppväxta i Uppsala. Sedan ett par år är musikerna bosatta i Uppsala och Gävle och ensemblen kommer att ge flera konserter i Uppsala under säsongen 2011-2012.
</p><p>
Ända sedan starten har Aniarakvartetten haft ett stort intresse för samtida musik. De medverkade redan som helt nybildad med konserter och inspelningar för danska radion under festivalen Ung Nordisk Musik. Sedan dess har de tillägnats och uruppfört ett 15-tal verk för stråkkvartett varav flera spelats in på skiva. Bland tonsättare som skrivit för Aniarakvartetten kan nämnas Gunnar Valkare, Staffan Mossenmark, Daniel Nelson, Thomas Liljeholm samt Anna-Lena Laurin.";"bilder/spacer.gif"

</p><p>
Centered around the concept of the lab as a venue for a review of artistic work as process, the ambition is to merge various kinds of knowledge production in the arts with various analytical modes of thinking. Each member of the research project will direct sessions to which a wide range of artists and scholars will be invited to contribute in the form of performances, art works, papers, lecture recitals and any other format that is pertinent to the argument one wants to make.
</p><p>
These lab sessions are the core of the event. However, (Re)thinking Improvisation also hosts a series of public concerts in and around Malmö. There will be no parallel sessions so all participants can take part in all labs and, furthermore, each day invited artists/scholars will sum up and critically review the sessions that have taken place.
</p><p>
Our ambition is to create a format for discussion and dissemination of artistic work and thinking about and through artistic work, while avoiding the all too common theory/practice dichotomies and allow for a creative and intellectually vital environment in which artistic and scholarly approaches to the topic of improvisation can be molded together.
</p><p>
The sessions will primarily take place in the facilities of the Inter Arts Center which affords flexible and technically well equipped venues for both music and visual arts. In addition, some of the sessions and many of the public concerts will be scheduled in other venues that are particularly suited for the content of the event.

Drottning Kristinas väg 51, Stockholm";"Go To Hell: gesture and sound on the threshold.
</p><p>
Go to Hell is an installation and performance work set on the threshold between gesture and sound and between the worlds of the dead and the living. The three musicians of the Vietnamese/Swedish group The Six Tones move through the subterranean landscape of the dismantled R1 nuclear reactor like mythological after-images. Fragments from the myth of Orpheus are double-exposed with the tale of a beheaded ghost from Vietnamese Tuong theatre. Evoked by the potential danger of the location, the audience is invited to explore an interactive and open form installation that relates to ancient myth and its bearings on experimental art of today. The choreographies and video art all relate to the gestural and conceptual content of Toccata Orpheus, a composition for guitar solo by the German composer Rolf Riehm.

</p><p>
In Toccata Orpheus it is the radical expression of the lyre players art that threatens the order of the underworld. Orpheus plays a high-risk game and exposes all the tricks of his musical and scenic skills expressed in intense choreographies of hand and arm movements. A new sound and video installation, by Anders Elberling and Henrik Frisk, an interactive sound and light installation by Gerhard Eckel and the interactive electronic soundscape in the space are derived from analysis of video recordings and of motion tracking data from performance of Riehms composition. The fragile plucked sounds and the details of gesture are transposed into an interactive multimedia composition of light, video, sound and movement in Go To Hell.

\"The 1960s and 70s witnessed numerous revolutions and radical social change. Natural and man-made sounds and noises - the outsiders of classical music history - were no longer rejected, but were even embraced as material and a new standard for aesthetics and philosophy of music.

";"Méliès is sometimes referred to as the first \"Cinemagician\". Two of his best-known films are A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904). Both stories involve strange, surreal voyages, somewhat in the style of Jules Verne, and are considered among the most important early science fiction films, though their approach is closer to fantasy. Méliès was also an early pioneer of horror cinema, which can be traced back to his Le Manoir du diable (1896).";"bilder/spacer.gif"

<p>Efter några decennier av konstnärlig forskning i Sverige har vi kommit långt. Många avhandlingar och seniora projekt, ett flöde inom flera fält som är fördelat på många olika ämnen och teman. Floran av metoder som åberopas blir större och teoriutvecklingen går långsamt framåt. Men det är min uppfattning att det finns ett område där vi fortfarande har långt kvar: forskningsprojekten relaterar inte till varandra i tillräcklig stor utsträckning. Resultatet blir att vi får en samling isolerade kunskapsöar utan broar vilket får till följd att vi inte bygger en dynamisk konstnärlig forskningsidentitet. Konstnärlig forskning är ofta definierad utifrån en individuellt orienterad frågeställning men jag vill hävda att detta inte är del av problemet. Det finns ingen motsättning mellan starkt individualistiskt orienterade forskningprojekt och en bred förankring i tidigare forskning. Jag vill också hävda att vi kan inte bygga ett fungerande forskningsområde utan att de enskilda projekten bygger på en bred kännedom om fältet och att denna tydligt redovisas i arbetet.</p>";"bilder/spacer.gif"

<h2>CCRMA / The Six Tones</h2>

A year ago, The Six Tones were commissioned by the online journal Verse Junkies to do a piece from a reading by a Thai poet, Zakariya Amataya. We were all quite taken by the political urgency and poetic power of his writings, and perhaps most of all, by the strange music that emerged from working with his reading and immediately started talking about releasing a CD continuing along the same lines. In 2014 we are now planning to record a CD to explore this initial encounter further.&#8232;We chose to work with the reading mainly from a musical perspective, though we did also have a translation to English. The process was such that we first made a simple graphic score outlining the tonal patterns and rhythmical shapes in the reading. Then, we recorded the music in an additive process, where each musician would listen to the reading and then improvise a part along with it, also reacting to the score. We added interludes between the verses in the poem, gradually expanding the piece to a musically more interesting shape.&#8232;We imagine to explore this method in this concert in various ways. One approach is to make a version according to a project by the American composer Bill Brooks. he describes it in the following way: After Yeats is not a score for performance but rather a method for determining a score; it extends W. B. Yeatss practice of poetic declamation to languages other than English. After Yeats describes a collaboration between a performer, who declaims a Yeats poem in translation, self-accompanied by a plucked string instrument, and a composer, who works at a remove to observe and amplify the implications of the declamation.&#8232;Nguyen Thanh Thuys reading of a Yeats translation to Vietnamese is now becoming the source for a new composition by Henrik Frisk. the intention is to use this material also in a further development of a more complex composition by The Six Tones in the spirit of With Only My Hands. This networked performance with musicians at the Inter Arts Center and at CCRMA, Stanford University also relates to the ongoing research collaboration between Lund University and Stanford concerned with the relation between music and language.";"bilder/drinking-excerpt.png"

It will now be performed again at the festival Tacit or Loud in Malmö Monday December 1 at 8pm in the black room of Inter arts centre.";"Anders Elberling and myself have worked for several years and we have a research project currently in the works. We are investigating the relationship between audio and video in integrated works, both live and fixed media. 
<h4>Il se tourna</h4>
<h2>Henrik Frisk / Anders Elberling&#8232;</h2>

This work, commissioned for the performance installation Go to Hell in October 2013, is a reflection on the myth of the famous musician and poet Orpheus whose attempt to save his loved Eurydice from the underworld ends with fatal consequences. There are many different transcriptions of the myth, the most commonly referred version is from the time of Virgil in which Eurydice died from a fatal bite while attempting to escape a satyr. Another Roman poet, Ovid, wrote a version in which Eurydices death followed from her dancing with water nymphs on her wedding night. The moral undertone of this version is fascinating and opens up for different interpretations. Furthermore, then ending exists in several versions and with different, less tragic outcomes.&#8232;In this work we have superimposed the different versions but focused on the moment of Orpheus turning around, the fatal mistake that makes him loose Eurydice for good. Giving in to his desire to again see the face of his loved one, or is it perhaps his anxiety that Persephone and Hades have fooled him, is undoubtedly a big mistake? The video is a long ascending movement from the underworld and the original version with three screens made it impossible to see all screens at the same time. The viewer finds herself in a position similar to Orpheus dilemma.";"bilder/elisk.jpg"

Katt Hernandez moved to Stockholm in 2010, after living in the Boston and Philadelphia areas for thirteen years, playing improvised and various other sorts of music on the violin, producing shows, and helping to run spaces. She quickly became involved in many new projects, including The Schematics, Stakenäs/Sandell/Hernandez trio, Hernandez/Erlandsson duo, Yun Kan 10, Klas Nevrin Ensemble and many other collaborations. Katt has also recently earned a Masters degree in Electro-acoustic composition from Kungliga Musik Högskolan (the Royal Music Academy of Sweden), where she studied with William Brunson, and continues her work in electro-acoustic composition at EMS (the Electronic Music Studio of Sweden). She has performed in many festivals in Europe, including Hagenfesten, Norberg, Geiger Festivalen, Berlin Bienalle and Sound of Stockholm. She also works as an assistant producer at Fylkingen, and has recently become the head of the board of directors for F.R.I.M. (Swedens organization for the promotion of improvised music),

This weekend it will be performed three times in the <a href=\"https://www.uniarts.fi/tapahtumat/su-07052017-1941/research-pavilion-repetition-repeats-all-other-repetitions-access\">CRT Theatre in Guidecca, Venice</a>, at 11, 15 and 17.";"In the preparatory phase, and through the first incarnations of the piece, the idea of a radically open work type, the work-in-movement, crystallised. One of the conditions that allowed for the development of this openness was the disassembly of the hierarchies attached to the roles of composer and performer, and one of its consequences was that several articulations of intuition was allowed to play a great role in the work. Another key factor was the video documentation of the artistic process and the further analysis of this material, carried out as part of our respective PhD projects. What emerged from these procedures, specifically grounded in an artistic practice articulated as research, was an enforced understanding of the identity of the work as a work-in-movement, in which the access to the sum of the documented working process and the instantiations of the work in performance would constitute its fluid identity. 
</p><p>In 2007 we entered the complete documentation of the piece in a database with the intention of creating an online representation of the composition. However, that project has remained unfinished to date. The concept of a musical composition which draws its identity from multiple representations in an organised form for storage, making the various kinds of documentation easily accessible, is what drives our current work. The proposed presentation discusses how we envision a new phase in which the database will provide the source material for a multi-media representation of the composition, with the aim to further explore its nature as a work-in-movement. Further, we will in the presentation argue that the access provided by the database, and the representations generated by it, as well as the research process which underlies the artistic results, constitute the very grounds on which the identity of the work can be understood. 
</p><p>
This project has been connected to the notion of access-oriented thought ever since its beginning in 2006. Aesthetically, in the ways in which it destabilizes the notion of the musical work (a discussion which has been central to classical western music since the mid 20th Century); scientifically, by its use of research oriented methods for documentation and database storage; and politically, by an act of counter-hegenomy by shifting the focus on results - typical of the musical art world - towards process and thereby, from the final product and its author to the user. 
The proposed presentation would have the format of a lab in which a series of performances of the composition would be distributed over a day. In between the performances, a demonstration of the database, and how different versions and stages can be accessed through this platform, will be discussed from an aesthetic, scientific and political perspective.

<a href=\"http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=19&show=1#19\">Machinic propositions</a> is an artistic project and an attempt to critically examine Deleuze and Guattaris theorems of deterritorialization as found in chapter seven and ten of their seminal book A Thousand Plateaus (Deleuze & Guattari, 1980). The output will be an audio-visual expression with the same over-arching goal to attempt to counteract the predominance of one medium over the other. Our objective is not to integrate them, but to approach what is described as \"a confidence with no possible interlocutor\" (Deleuze & Parnet, 2006). Our artistic method is one where conceptual deduction and improvisation play central roles. It has grown out of our thinking about contemporary media and our attempts to critically examine both our own pro-technical approach and the hyper media- landscape we live in. This method was developed based on our artistic ideas, the needs of the projects we engage in and the conditions of
our respective practices. At the core of our work lies the attempt to deconstruct the relationship between sound and image. Our work process is slow and meticulous. The work on the present project began over a year ago and is likely to continue past the premiere at the Dare conference in November 2017. In other words, the actual work only materializes at the very end of a relatively long process of interaction.

<h3>Henrik Frisk & Stefan Östersjö: The Ear of Migration: a projected documentary film</h3>

In Inerferens #5 I will also present a project together with Stefan Östersjö recently financed by the Marcus and Amalia Wallenberg foundation.
The Ear of Migration is a film project in the form of a documentary looking at the soundscape of migration. It will become the second collaboration between the Vietnamese/American filmmaker and cultural theorist Trinh T. Minh-ha and the Vietnamese/Swedish group The Six Tones1. This documentary creates several layers of reflection from migrated artists. First, through an experimental music project set in Sweden, with explicit political aims, in which the voice of each
participating artist becomes a reflective articulation of the experience of migration. Second, a further reflection is created through interviews with the director of the film, about her own experiences of migrating from Vietnam to the USA. ";"bilder/news/MachinicGent2017.jpg"

</p>
<p>
ArtDoc is an experimental archive primarily for the purpose of documenting artistic practice. One of the ambitions is to address the question of how artistic practice may be documented in a manner that makes visible the processes in action. ArtDoc has its roots in research and artistic practice that began over ten years ago and preliminary tests shows it to be a useful complement to other means to document musical works and artistic processes. The particular case of open form works, works that in some respect are negotiated between the different agents involved, such as composers, musicians and members of the audience, was a point of departure and has guided the development to a significant degree. The underlying structure of documentation classes is discussed and an example of how the archive may be used in connection with the speaker dome Klangkupolen in Lilla Salen at the Royal college of music is presented.";"bilder/spacer.gif"

</p><p>
The modes of synchronization that have become central to our works will be further explored through the modes of thinking relating to the theorems introduced by D\\&G. There are however, many points of entry. The systems of de/re-territorialization in this context are interpreted as attempts to detach both sound and image from their highly defined modes of engagement. Not in order for them to merge into one, but to become what may be described as the opposite of a couple.";"bilder/news/machinic-compilation.png"

</p><p>
Music performance anxiety (MPA) has been studied mainly within the field of psychology and has been defined as a sub-type of social anxiety. Musicians suffering from MPA are commonly referred to individual psychological treatment, but the condition is not yet researched from an artistic perspective. The hypothesis put forward in this article is that the issues concerning MPA are part of a complex system of interactions between performance values and perfectionism and that musicians in general are not given the necessary tools to tackle the anxiety. One of the challenges is that Western classical music performance has many built-in values that needs to be problematized and researched in order to address the problems with MPA. Hence, MPA is not to be considered as solely an individual problem but should rather be seen as the result of a wider structural issue related to the commodification of classical Western music and its focus on perfection and virtuosity. The article gives an example from the field of artistic research on how it is possible for the performer herself to develop methods to understand and emotionally regulate the impact of perfectionism in Western classical music.

The publications are both a result of the individual research processes, and are, as a whole, illustrating the many possibilities of a format, where sound, time, timbre, rhythm, simultaneity and complex dramaturgy are refining, and perhaps re-defining, how an academic argument can be presented.The audio paper, just as its companion format of the video essay (Kiss and Berg, 2016), is indeed creating new avenues for practice-based research fields to interact with the larger community in novel ways. But furthermore, this movement away from the hegemony of the written word towards sonic and visual modes of communication holds a promise for an acknowledgement of the transmodal nature of human perception, and an embodied understanding of knowledge, in academia, in the arts and in everyday life.

Departing from the artistic research project Goodbye Intuition (GI) hosted by the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo, this article discusses the aesthetics of improvising with machines. Playing with a system such as the one described in this article, with limited intelligence and no real cognitive skills, will obviously reveal the weaknesses of the system, but it will also convey part of the preconditions and aesthetic frameworks that the human improviser brings to the table. If we want the autonomous system to have the same kind of freedom we commonly value in human players? improvisational practice, are we prepared to accept that it may develop in a direction that departs from our original aesthetical ambitions? The analyses is based on some of the documented interplay between the musicians in a group in workshops and laboratories. The question of what constitutes an ethical relationship in this kind of improvisation is briefly discussed. The aspect of embodiment emerges as a central obstacle in the development of musical improvisation with machines.";"bilder/spacer.gif"

<p>
I denna presentation kommer jag diskutera ett samarbete mellan KMH (Kungl. Musikh&ouml;gskolan) och KTH (Kungl. Tekniska H&ouml;gskolan) som initierades 2016. En av m&aring;ls&auml;ttningarna var att bygga upp en forskningsmilj&ouml; i n&auml;ra interaktion med grundutbildningen samt att m&ouml;jligg&ouml;ra en gemensam forskarutbildning. Programmet v&auml;nde sig till anst&auml;llda l&auml;rare p&aring; KMH som hade intresse f&ouml;r forskning. De l&auml;rare som blev antagna fortsatte arbeta p&aring; 50% som l&auml;rare samtidigt som de f&ouml;ljde forskarutbildningen p&aring; KTH. Samtliga fyra doktorander hittills har involverat sina studenter i sin forskning, som en integrerad del av kurserna de undervisar. Studenterna har p&aring; s&aring; vis bidragit till forskningen vilket i sin tur har lett till en acceptans, forskningsmedvetenhet och intresse hos studenterna. H&auml;rut&ouml;ver har det p&aring;verkat kusrsplaneutveckling inom de &auml;mnen som det r&ouml;r.
</p>

<p>
Den konstn&auml;rliga forskningen i musik har haft en stark utveckling i Skandinavien under de senaste 20-30 &aring;ren. En anledning till framg&aring;ngen &auml;r att det relativt begr&auml;nsade antalet platser har g&aring;tt till etablerade musiker. Att studenter g&aring;r fr&aring;n grundutbildning till forskarutbildning direkt &auml;r ovanligt, om ens m&ouml;jligt. F&ouml;rdelen med detta &auml;r att forskarutbildningen inte har beh&ouml;vt koncentrera sig p&aring; den konstn&auml;rliga delen, utan ist&auml;llet mer p&aring; hur detta kan gestaltas som forskning. Nackdelen &auml;r att kopplingen mellan grundutbildning och forskning inte har beaktats i tillr&auml;ckligt stor utstr&auml;ckning. Forskarutbildningen har skett i ett sp&aring;r f&ouml;r sig och grundutbildningen har inte sett sig ha behov av den typen av kunskapsbildning som doktoranderna ofta intresserar sig f&ouml;r. Detta skapar flera utmaningar, inte minst som den konstn&auml;rliga akademin fortfarande p&aring; vissa st&auml;llen befinner sig i en konfliktliknande relation till det akademiska och akademiseringen ses som ett hot. L&ouml;sningen p&aring; den situationen &auml;r inte att akademisera det som &auml;nnu inte &auml;r akademiserat. Ist&auml;llet b&ouml;r vi str&auml;va efter att &aring; ena sidan g&ouml;ra forskningsresultat anv&auml;ndbara i konstn&auml;rlig undervisning, och &aring; andra sidan skapa milj&ouml;er i vilka &auml;ven konstn&auml;rlig praktik i, och f&ouml;r sig sj&auml;lv, ses som potentiella forskningsresultat.
