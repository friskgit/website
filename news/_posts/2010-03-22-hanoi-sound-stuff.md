I will be in Vietnam for two weeks (March 26 through April 7) for a performance at the <a href="http://hanoisoundstuff.com/">Hanoi Sound Stuff</a> festival with The Six Tones (Henrik Frisk, Nguyen Thanh Thuy, Ngo Tra My and Stefan Östersjö). Following the festival we will record with the Six Tones and Vietnamese guest musicians.
