My paper on <a href="index.jsp?id=proj&field=is_res&query=1">etherSound</a> has been accepted for the <a href="http://spark.cla.umn.edu/">Spark Festival and Conference</a>. The conference takes place February 17-20 and hosts guests DJ Spooky and Philippe Manoury. I have also been asked to set up <a href="index.jsp?id=comp&field=id&query=2">etherSound</a> during the festival.
