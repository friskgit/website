The Laboratory for Artistic Research, Interferens, is now presenting its fifth edition and for the occasion I will present the piece <em><a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=19&show=1#19">Machinic propositions</a></em>. On January 16-18 2018, the Malmö Academy of Music, in collaboration with NKFM (Nationellt Nätverk för Konstnärlig Forskning i Musik) is hosting the events that take place at IAC in Malmö. Interference #5 is a peer-reviewed and curated event in which the aim is to create a discourse within music research, drawn from performative and material perspectives on musical creativity. The atmosphere is that of sharing and joint exploration. In six thematically organized and curated sessions, artists and researchers will engage in a practice-based exploration of a series of perspectives on artistic experimentation, collaboration and the musician in society.
