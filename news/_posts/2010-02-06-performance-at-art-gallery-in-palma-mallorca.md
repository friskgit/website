On Friday February 12 I will do a performance and sound installtion at gallery Xavier Fiol in Palma Mallorca, in Spain. This is a collaboration with my long time friend and artist Stefan Lundgren. At the opening of his show <it>Crucifixions</it> I will do a laptop/saxophone improvisation and a recording of this improv will be played in the gallery for the duration of the show.
