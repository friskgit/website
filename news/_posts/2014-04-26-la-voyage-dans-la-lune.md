<img src="bilder/news/melies.jpg"></img>At the semester meeting in the <a href="http://www.konstnarligaforskarskolan.se/wordpress/">Swedish artistic research school</a> at Gotland we did an improvisation with the wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FrdVdKlxUk">Méliès film "A trip to the moon"</a>. The entire concept of playing music to film is something I am interested in exploring further. After several projects, notably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyoXQuCQn1s">Diagonalsymfonin</a> and the project with Isaac Julien and most recently, the <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=music&about=1">work I've done with Anders Elberling</a>, I would like to take it a step further.
