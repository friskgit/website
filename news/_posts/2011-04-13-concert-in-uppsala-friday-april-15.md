I'm doing a concert with Swedish viola player Erik Ring in Uppsala on Friday, April 15 at 19.00 at Nannaskolans Aula. The concert is part of the chamber music week arranged by the music school in Uppsala. The program features music by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigran_Mansurian">Tigran Mansurian</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bach">Bach</a> as well as improvisations.
