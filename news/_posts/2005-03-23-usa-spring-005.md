In late March I will be in California for concerts and teaching. Henrik Frendin will perform my piece <a href="index.jsp?metaId=music&amp;id=comp">Drive</a> at a concert at Santa Barbara University where we will also do a workshop. Along with Per Anders Nilsson I will perform in San Diego and CNMAT.
