After a lot of uncertainty it is now clear that I will be going to Minsk to do a performance with Swedish artist Stefan Lundgren on September 6. Together we will perform at a festival called <a href="http://navinki.smufsa.nu/2004/index_en.htm">Navinki</a> held at the Museum for Contemporary Art in Minsk, Belarus.</p><p>I have done a number of performances with Stefan over the years, but not since 2002 when we did a show in Dresden.
