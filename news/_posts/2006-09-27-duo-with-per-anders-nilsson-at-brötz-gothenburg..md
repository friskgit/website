On September 27, I will play a duo concert with laptop musician Per-Anders Nilsson at Br&ouml;tz in Gothenburg. The concert starts at 8 pm.</p>
I have played with Per-Anders on numerous occasions. In May 2005 we did a small tour in California (read more about the tour <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=news&about=1&field=id&query=15&show=-1">here</a>). He is a versatile musician with a great interest in using the laptop as an <em>instrument</em> - that is to really <emplay</em> the laptop. Consequnetly he has developed techniques to allow him to do exactly that.
