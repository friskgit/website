Stefan Östersjö and I have collaborated with British artist <a href="http://isaacjulien.com/home">Isaac Julien</a> and created new music for his extraordinary film Better Life. In a project related to his installation Ten Thousand Waves we will also perform the music live at the opening of <a href="http://goteborg.biennal.org/en/">Göteborg Intenational Biennal for Contemporary Art</a>.
