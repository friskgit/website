I will be doing a series of performances in the US in the upcoming week, starting already tonight with a performance at <a href="http://ibeambrooklyn.com/">IBeam</a> with Angelica Sanchez, Gustavo Aguilar and Earl Howard. Following that I am performing at the University of Maine Farmington, at <a href="http://www.g-a-s-p.net/">GASP art gallery</a> in Boston, solo as well as with Achile Succi and Neil Leonard, and finally at <a href="http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/event/2010/11/09/henrik_frisk_special_guests_anders_nilsson_and_david_wessel">CNMAT, Berkeley</a> with Per Anders Nilsson and Dave Wessel.
