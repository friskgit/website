The Swedish CD distribution company <a href="http://www.cda.se">CDA</a> has today announced that they will file a petition in bankruptcy. In practice this means that <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=disc&about=1">my CDs</a> as well as those by other artists at <a href="http://www.kopasetic.se">Kopasetic productions</a> will be (even) more difficult to come by. However, all <a href="http://www.kopasetic.se">Kopasetic Productions</a> may be bought from <a href="http://kopasetic.se/AlbumGallery_PP.asp?id=705">Kopasetic.se</a>
