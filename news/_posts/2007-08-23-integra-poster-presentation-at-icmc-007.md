On Monday morning I will be presenting an article about the <a href="http://www.integralive.org">Integra</a> library that primarily myself and <a href="http://www.postlude.co.uk/main">Jamie Bullock</a> has been working on. Please come and see me at Auditorium 3 at the School of Architecture in Copenhagen at 8.40 in the morning of Monday August 27.
