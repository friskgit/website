Ensemble ArsNova is performing my piece <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=12&show=1#12">The Mystic Writing Pad</a>, written for the ensemble's special project SwitchedOn at a concert in Malmö, December 4. The concert takes place at the brand new <a href="http://www.iac.lu.se/">InterArts Center</a> which is a very exciting inter-artistic center for contemporary art.

Apart from this premiere and the performance of new works by Kent Olofsson och Alessandro Perrini, a work by John Oliver, I will do an improvisation with guitarist Stefan Östersjö, saxophone virtuoso Jörgen Pettersson and the very special Polish guest Marek Choloniewski on laptop.
