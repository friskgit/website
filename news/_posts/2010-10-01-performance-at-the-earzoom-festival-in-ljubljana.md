I will be doing a solo saxophone/laptop performance on Monday October 1 at the EarZoom festival in Ljubljana, Slovenia. In addition to the concert I will also do a presentation on some of my ongoing research. The <a href="http://www.irzu.org/festival/festival.html">EarZoom festival</a> is curated by Miha Ciglar and is arranged by the <a href="http://www.irzu.org">IRZU</a> the newly established institute for sonic arts in Ljubljana.</p>
