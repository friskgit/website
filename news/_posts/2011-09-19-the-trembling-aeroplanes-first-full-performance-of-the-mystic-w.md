On Monday September 19 at 19.30 the digital ensemble The Trembling Aeroplanes will perform an exciting program of music by myself, Mattias Rodrick and Kent Olofsson. Kent's piece is a Hoerspiel, "les Portes de l'Enfer", produced in collaboration with Teatr Weimar with text by Jörgen Dahlqvist. In this concert the ensemble will perform the full version of my piece <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=12&show=1#12">The Mystic Writing Pad</a>.
