My trio lim has just finished recording a new CD with French guitarist Marc Ducret. We have played with Marc on a few occasions before but this is the first time we recorded in studio with him (though the live CD <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=disc&about=1&field=id&query=13">KOPAelectric</a> has three tracks with lim and Ducret). We are planning to release this CD in March next year.
