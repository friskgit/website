This years edition of the <a href="http://www.kopasetic.se">KOPAfestival</a> has already started with performances in Lund and Helsingborg. On Monday night I will be playing with an exciting project led by the multi-faceted <a href="http://www.scottstroman.com/">Scott Stroman</a> and soprano saxophone wizard Cennet JÃ¶nsson. The group features musicians such as Maggi Olin, Lena Willemark, Lisbeth Diers and Almaz Yebio among others, and the concert takes place in the great cathedral in Lund at 20.00, Monday October 10.
