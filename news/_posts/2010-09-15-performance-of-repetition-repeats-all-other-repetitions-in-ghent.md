Stefan Östersjö is performing my piece <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=8&show=1#8">Repetition Repeats all other Repetitions</a> at the <a href="http://www.orpheusinstituut.be/en/home">ORCiM research festival</a> in Ghent, Belgium tonight. The new version of the piece is the first that actually implements all of the original ideas with regard to interaction and dynamic form.
