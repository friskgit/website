On June 7 I will do a concert at the <a href="http://www.violacongress2006.ca/">International Viola Congress</a> in Montreal together with Swedish viola player <a href="http://www.frendin.com">Henrik Frendin</a>. </p>
<p>
The concert starts at 10:30 and was originally to be held at Lion d'Or, but has been moved. Check the <a href="http://www.violacongress2006.ca/">program</a> for updates.
