I will be playing in Malm&ouml; two nights in the upcoming week. The first occasion is an exciting Swedish/Danish/Vietnamese collaboration, an offspring of the Hanoi New Music Meeting that took place last October. The second is my live premiere with my band <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=proj&about=1&field=id&query=6">Ooko</a> featuring <a href="www.myspace.com/katrineamsler ">Katrine Amsler</a> and <a href="ww.myspace.com/michalaostergaard">Michala &Ouml;stergaard-Nielsen</a> on piano and drums respectively.
