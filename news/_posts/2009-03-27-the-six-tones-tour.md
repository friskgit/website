The Six Tones is a Swedish-Vietnamese project featuring Stefan Östersjö, Nguyen Thanh Thuy and Ngo Tra My. On this tour, starting March 28 in Stockholm and ending April 4 in Härnösand, Henrik Frisk will also perform live electronics with the trio, in his own piece as well as in improvisations. The collaboration started in the spring of 2006 with the main ambition to create a foundation for a meeting between two different musical cultures on equal terms.
