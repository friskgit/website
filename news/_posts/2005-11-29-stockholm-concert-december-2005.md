I will be performing with Henrik Frendin and Michael Reuter at the Music Academy in Stockholm on December 1, 7 pm. The program is a mixture of improvisations and composition by myself, Kent Olofsson, Erik Enstr&ouml;m and Henrik Frendin. The concert is part of KMH's concert and seminar series Impro Lab and after the concert we will be doing a seminar on improvisation along with Marcus Lindahl from KTH, Stockholm.
