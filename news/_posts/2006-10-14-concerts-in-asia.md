Together with guitarrist Stefan &Ouml;stersj&ouml; I will be doing two concerts in Asia over the next couple of weeks. One in Hanoi and one in Beijing as part of the <a href="http://cemc.ccom.edu.cn/">Musicacoustica</a> festival. In Beijing we will also participate in the <a href="http://www.ems.dmu.ac.uk/ems06/">EMS06</a> conference.
