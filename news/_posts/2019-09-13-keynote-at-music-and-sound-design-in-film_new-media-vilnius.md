The 3rd international conference on sound in film and new media in Vilnius focuses this year on soundscapes and immersive sound. I will give a keynote on the topic of narrative interaction between sound and image in the piece <a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=19&show=1#19">Machinic Propositions</a> by Anders Elberling and myself (<a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=proj&about=1">Mongrel</a>). The piece was also performed in the festival in the souround sound dome of MiSC at the conservatory of music in Vilnius.
