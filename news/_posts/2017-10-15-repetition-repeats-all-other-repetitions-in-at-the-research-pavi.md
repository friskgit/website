<a href="http://www.henrikfrisk.com/index.jsp?metaId=music&id=comp&field=id&query=9&show=1#9">Repetition Repeats all other Repetitions</a> is an open form composition for 10-stringed guitar and electronics. The piece emerged out of a collaboration between the composer Henrik Frisk and the guitarist Stefan Östersjö and developed into an artistic research project in which interaction, in the widest sense, was allowed to play a major part. This weekend it will be performed three times in the <a href="https://www.uniarts.fi/tapahtumat/su-07052017-1941/research-pavilion-repetition-repeats-all-other-repetitions-access">CRT Theatre in Guidecca, Venice</a>, at 11, 15 and 17.
