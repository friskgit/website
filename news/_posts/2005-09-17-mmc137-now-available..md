<a href="http://www.mmcrecordings.com/detail.asp?id=143"><img src="http://www.mmcrecordings.com/images/large/2137.jpg" alt="CD Cover"></a>The recording of my piece Tetrachordal Variations (I know, the title really sucks...) is now out and available. You can buy it <a href="http://www.mmcrecordings.com/detail.asp?id=143">here</a>. In this recording with the Warszaw Philhormonic Orchestra, myself and Richie Beirach are soloists.
